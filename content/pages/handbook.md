# Handbook

This handbook represents what values we hold dear at We Are Wizards and describe the work environment we offer.

This document will never be '1.0' and we welcome comments or even pull requests on our [github repo](https://github.com/WeAreWizards/blog).
It also serves as an introduction to We Are Wizards for future employees, clients and collaborators.

## What We Are Wizards offers to employees

We believe that work is only a small part of our life and recognizes that many — if not all — of us have plenty of other things we want to do: family to spend time with, books to read, places to travel to, sports to do, video games to beat and the list goes on forever.  

Rather than having you sitting in an office despite not actually really needing you there, we prefer a flexible work environment.  
That is, work when you want and from wherever you want. As long as the job is done, feel free to go to the beach at 2pm (hopefully you aren't in London).   
Unfortunately if you are working on a project with a team, there are 2 constraints that are necessary:

- have some working hours overlap with the other team members
- be available for the meetings (and we try to keep them to lowest possible amount)

So you can pick where you are working from and when you are working. How about choosing what you want to work on?  
As an agency we obviously can't completely choose our projects (while only choosing fun projects would be nice, it's quite unrealistic), but you can choose which project to work on or just have a peek at the commits if it's something you're interested in but not confident enough to use.  
On top of that, we believe that dedicating 20-30% of the work time to side-projects and various learning/sharing activities is the way to go.

A few more things we offer and I didn't manage to put in a sentence above:

- complete internal transparency, everyone knows where the company is at
- informal company with no hierarchy
- lots of gifs
