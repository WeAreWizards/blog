[Back in March](https://blog.wearewizards.io/we-are-launching-our-first-product) we announced [Proppy](https://proppy.io/), our tool to write beautiful proposals.

With all the excitement after releasing Proppy last week, we actually forgot to blog about it!
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

After more than 6 months of constant improvements in beta and over 1500 signups, we have decided that Proppy is at the point where it is a tool worth paying for.

Some larger features like analytics and integrations are still missing but they are actively being worked on and will land soon.

If you are writing proposals, have a look at [https://proppy.io](https://proppy.io) and let us know what you think!

We're going to blog a bit more about the design process and the tech over the next few weeks. Stay tuned.
