Short_summary: After wrangling with proposals for a while we productized one of our internal tools.
Category: Product
Authors: Vincent, Tom

*Reading time: ~3 minutes.*

At We Are Wizards we send out a fair number of proposals. In our early
days we developed a
[command line tool](https://github.com/WeAreWizards/proppy) to
generate consistent and error-free proposals - and this turned out to
be super useful.

We've taken our little tool and made it into a webapp so others can
benefit from this, too.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

When sending out proposals we identified a few pain points:

* Keeping track of the proposal status and comments in an email thread
  doesn't really work.
* PDFs aren't a great format for the wild number of devices people are
  using these days, and they don't allow for interactive content like
  videos.
* Keeping cost table sums up to date is error prone without copying
  from a spreadsheet.
* Collaboration via Dropbox is painful.

We've addressed each of those and the result can be found here:
[https://proppy.io/](https://proppy.io/)

We're in the process of shaking out the last few bugs so we're calling
it *beta*, but our friends and us have been using it for a while and
they love it.

We also have a few more features planned like electronic signatures,
more content types (schedules, team descriptions, ...), and analytics.

Give it a try and let us know what you think: [https://proppy.io/](https://proppy.io/)!
