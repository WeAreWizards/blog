Short_summary: After wrangling with proposals for a while we productized one of our internal tools.

*Reading time: ~3 minutes.*

At We Are Wizards we send out a fair number of proposals. In our early
days we developed a command line tool to generate consistent and
error-free proposals - and this turned out to be super useful.

We've taken our ramshackle tool and made it into a full product so
others can benefit from this, too.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

When sending out proposals we identified a few pain points:

* Keeping track of the proposal status in an email thread doesn't
  really work.
* PDFs aren't a great format for the wild number of devices people
  are using these days.
* Keeping cost table sums up to date is error prone without copying
  from a spreadsheet.
* Collaboration via Dropbox is painful.

We've addressed each of those and the result can be found here:

We're in the process of shaking out the last few bugs so we're calling
it *beta*, but our friends and us have been using it for a while and
are quite happy.

Give it a try and let us know what you think!
