Hey everyone,

Together with the excellent Simone Trubian we are organising a [second NixOs meetup in London the 3rd of May](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7926-london-nixos-user-group), in a space generously provided by <i>skills matter</i>.

This time we're trying something different: A hands-on meeting. I will give a ~20 minute talk about the weird Nix language, and then we will apply our skills to add or update a package for NixOS.

Tickets are limited and you can grab them [here](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7926-london-nixos-user-group).
