Hey everyone,  

We are organising a NixOs meetup in London the 21st of April at 7pm, in space generously provided by [Mozilla London](https://goo.gl/maps/EyM1r) (it's a really cool space!).
Tickets are limited and you can grab them on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/london-nixos-meetup-tickets-16331038576).
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

There will be pizza, drinks, a talk and socializing.  
Since this is the first event, we will try to figure out what people want out of it.
